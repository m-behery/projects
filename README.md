# Introduction

This repository is the first step in an effort to establish a scientific community interested in taking Machine Learning, in terms of learning its philosophy and applying it, to the next level. It is to include advanced topics in Machine Learning being applied in a simple straightforward investigative approach on Linux machines.

# Rules

- **Advanced machine learning algorithms** are to be applied here **entirely from scratch** using academic papers and/or other resources referring to them (e.g. articles and instructional videos).

- **An algorithm is to be entirely applied in a single Jupyter Notebook** containing every stage in a well-coded, modular and concise manner; that primarily includes the bash statements required to download the data and unzip them if need be. This means that if someone is to download that notebook and install its dependencies, it should run entirely without giving any errors.

- Each code developed from scratch has intrinsically an experimental nature that should be treated in a well documented manner, in terms of including (1) an **Implementation Methodology** section which cites all references in use while implementing that code making sure to give credit where it is due, any discrepencies or mistakes found while using these references and how they were resolved. And (2) a **Conclusion** section which summarizes the end result of applying that code and the reasoning behind such result.
